## Instructions for building out a Raspberry Pi based Home Theater PC
I've done this several times now, and eventually the wheels fall off, necessitating another build. Rather than continuously starting from square one and researching what to do from scratch, I'm putting this instructional together in the hopes of saving some time on my subsequent rebuilds. 

### Requirements
The description in the brackets is my build
* A Raspberry Pi computer [Raspberry Pi 2 Model B]
* An SD card with at least an 8 GB capacity []
* A functioning computer with an SD card reader [Lenovo ThinkPad T500 running Lubuntu 20.04]

### Step by Step Installation
1. Install Raspberry Pi OS (formerly Raspbian) to your SD card using the image writer of your choice. For simplicity's sake, I used the official Raspberry Pi Imager (v 1.4) to install the [Raspberry Pi OS with Desktop image](https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspios_armhf/images/raspios_armhf-2020-08-24/2020-08-20-raspios-buster-armhf.zip).
